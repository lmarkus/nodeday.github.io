#Pre-event checklist

* Do we have the gifts for the speakers?
* Do we have enough room in for the speaker breakfast? 
* How do we want to run the speaker breakfast? Go around room introduce and then just keep informal?
* Will we have a break time to get over to the main area?
* Do we have reserved seating for the speakers and all of the influencers?
* Do you have volunteers for the event? (12 seems to be the magic number)
* It may be raining, so if we don’t have the patio area, guessing people can eat in main room too?
* Will there be a timekeeper to keep people moving?
* What will the twitter hash tag be? (#NodeDay)
* Do we have the wifi password posted?
* Will we have dedicated ethernet for the speakers on the podium?
* Is there a system of having the speakers go back to back to get wired up while the next speaker is coming up?
* Send an email and ask people one last time (weather is not so good so some might change their mind) that if they can’t make it, to please respond so we can free up tickets for others on the waiting list. 
* Will there be a survey form? (We don’t necessarily need it, but might be good — but probably too late).
* The plan is to display a big QR code at the event wrap-up and ask people to scan it.  QR points to -> https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SRX633X
* It’s a super simple, 3-question survey. Personally, I hate filling out surveys, so I kept it as simple as possible. I think we can still get some good feedback out of it. 
* Is A/V support prepped on the event?
* Will there be a dedicated AV person through the day?
